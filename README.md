# XJCO1921 Testing Example

A simple test script for the factorial program.

## To run the script...

You will need to give yourself run permissions for the script by copy and pasting this into the terminal:

```bash
chmod +x test.sh
```

Then you can run:

```bash
./test.sh
```

# Optional Task

Try to fix the failing parts of the code. Don't 'fix' the tests, work out why they are failing and fix `code.c`.

There are bits missing and bits which don't work as expected - both need finding and fixing.
